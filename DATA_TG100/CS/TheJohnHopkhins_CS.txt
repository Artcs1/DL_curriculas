Parallel Programming
This course prepares the programmer to tackle the massive data sets and huge problem size of modern scientific and enterprise computing. Google and IBM have commented that undergraduate CS majors are unable to "break the single server mindset" (http://www.google.com/intl/en/ press/pressrel/20071008_ibm_univ.html). Students taking this course will abandon the comfort of serial algorithmic thinking and learn to harness the power of cutting-edge software and hardware technologies. The issue of parallelism spans many architectural levels. Even ``single server'' systems must parallelize computation in order to exploit the inherent parallelism of recent multi-core processors. The course will examine different forms of parallelism in four sections. These are: (1) massive data-parallel computations with Hadoop!; (2) programming compute clusters with MPI; (3) thread-level parallelism in Java; and, (4) GPGPU parallel programming with NVIDIA's Cuda
