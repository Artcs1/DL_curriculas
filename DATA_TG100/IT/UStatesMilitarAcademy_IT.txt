Distributed Application Development (Python Django)
Building on the foundations of algorithm implementation, data representation, web development, and basic networking, this course focuses on the principles of constructing a modern distributed application. Cadets study the principles, construction, and interaction of user interface, network, web server, and database components to produce an effective distributed application. Cadets will learn new tools and skills working as a team to analyze, design, and implement a system that solves a given problem.
/
User Interface Development (Python)
This course provides a practical introduction to user interface development and usability engineering of interactive applications. The disciplines of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Cybersecurity, and Software Engineering guide these endeavors. Major emphasis is on the principles and techniques for human-centered, secure design and implementation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) within a software development lifecycle. Cadets will extend their knowledge of programming in a high-level language by learning how to use an interface builder to create a fully functional GUI. Cadets will learn and practice human-centered problem analysis techniques and testing methodologies to ensure that their interfaces are usable and secure. A hypothetico-deductive approach to design is emphasized throughout their development efforts. Fundamentals taught in this course will prepare cadets for more advanced software development, development of physical devices, or a deeper theoretical look at HCI topics.

Homeland Security
The goal of this course is to provide future leaders with a thorough understanding of the homeland security policy area. This course explores how the evolving nature of the terorist threat, particularly catastrophic terrorism, poses unprecedented and complex challenges to how America provides for its security. The course examines how homeland security policy intersects with other domestic and foreign policy issues, how our federalist system of government affects homeland security, and how moral, ethical, and civil liberties concerns complicate the development of effective homeland security policies. By analyzing the threat and developing an understanding of the unique policy problems and tools of homeland security, the course enables students to critically assess national efforts in such areas as border security, domestic counterterrorism policy, critical infrastructure protection, and emergency preparedness and response.
/
Cyber Security Engineering
The focus for this course is to design, build and test secure networked computer systems. Topics covered include operating system and network security, secure network architecture, and offensive and defensive information operations. Practical exercises that give students hands-on experience with current network security tools and techniques complement a series of laboratory exercises that have small groups of cadets secure their own small network.
