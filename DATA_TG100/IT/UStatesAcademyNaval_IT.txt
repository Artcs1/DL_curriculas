APPLICATIONS OF CYBER ENGINEERING
This course focuses on the engineering aspects of cyber operations, cyber defense, and cyber attacks, as a follow-on to SY110. There are three main areas of study, including the host section (a single computer terminal), the network section, and the wireless communication section. Each area of study culminates in a detailed description of a common type of cyber attack and the defenses against it. Lecture material is reinforced and supplemented with labs/security exercise that demonstrate the theoretical concepts in an isolated, virtual environment.

Intro to Computer Science
Introduction to algorithmic development, problem solving and software design. Principles and concepts to provide foundational knowledge and experience upon which later computing courses will build
/
Object-Oriented Programming
This course builds on the procedural programming skills developed in the prerequisite course and introduces the student to object oriented programming and design principles using Java. Object oriented topics such as classes, inheritance, information hiding, polymorphism and dynamic binding are presented and used to create robust, reusable, and maintainable software
/
Computer Architecture and Organization
This course introduces students to performance metrics, instruction set architectures, assembly language, logic design, memory hierarchies, and pipelining.
/
Systems Programming
The study of an application's interface with the operating system. The operating system is treated as an information resource, and as a facilitator for information flow between processes, including those executing on separate machines. Topics include: process management, multiprogramming, and the basic concepts necessary to understand the design and operation of computer communication networks
/
Data Structures
This course examines abstract data types (ADT), data structures, data representation and information management including storage structures, allocation and collection. ADTs and data structures presented include lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, priority queues, maps, dictionaries and graphs. Sorting and searching techniques, hashing and graph algorithm analysis are also covered.
/
Computer Networks
The course presents the fundamental theoretical concepts, characteristics and principles of computer communications and computer networks, and analyzes and assesses these foundational concepts with respect to network performance and network design.
/
