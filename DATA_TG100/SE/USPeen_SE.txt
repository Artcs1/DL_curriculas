There are two main branches of economics, microeconomics, and macroeconomics. Macroeconomics is concerned with economy--wide factors such as inflation, unemployment, and overall economic growth. Microeconomics deals with the behavior of individual households and firms and how government influences that behavior;

Embedded Real Time Systems
Embedded Real Time Systems (3) Real time operating systems is the study of hardware/software systems in which timing constraints must be met for correctness. Real time systems are embedded in applications ranging from the antilock brakes in cars to the flight control systems for jetliners. Students are first introduced to the concept of systems with real time constraints by examining case studies. The unified modeling languages (UML) with real time extension is introduced allowing students to capture the constraints present in the systems in a variety of models allowing the problem to be described at several levels of abstraction. Tasks and messages are introduced as programming structures which can satisfy the constraints described by the UML models. With a basic understanding of real time systems and how to implement them, the focus of the course shifts away from these technical concerns towards understanding the documentation of the requirements using the Volere Requirements Specification template

Software Verification, Validation, and Testing
Software Verification, Validation, and Testing (3) Provides a background necessary for verification, validation, and testing of software systems. Verification addresses the question: &quot;are we building the product right?&quot; In other words, does the product meet the engineering specifications? Validation addresses whether the right product is being built and if it meets the design requirements. The testing aspect of the course addresses many of the methods available to test software systems. The levels of testing explored are 1) unit level (each module is tested independently), 2) integration testing (where the modules are integrated together and tested as a complete system), and 3) acceptance testing (the testing requirements of the users). Following this, specific test methodologies are addressed. By the end of this course the student should also be able to develop an appropriate test plan.

Data Structure and Algorithms

Software Architecture
Software Architecture (3)This course introduces the frequently-used software infrastructures in software development by experienced engineers. The formal UML notations are utilized to design software architecture and help communicate the design visually. Students will learn the real practice of architectural styles, design patterns and design reuse. As to certain complex problems, alternative architectures will be proposed and their design trade offs will be evaluated. For instance, students compare two-tier with three-tier client/server architectures for distributed systems, and employ multi-process and multi-thread concurrent architectures for high performance computation systems. Moreover, students learn to conduct high level quality analysis from the design artifacts. The quality evaluation will focus on a number of attributes, including reusability, extendibility and performance. A great deal of effort is placed on the major categories of design types containing dozens of separate design patterns. Students first review the most fundamental design patterns. Afterwards, they apply creational patterns to effectively create objects, partitioning patterns to categorize objects, structural patterns to allocate objects, behavioral patterns to interface the communication between objects, and concurrent patterns to handle tasks simultaneously. These skills will enable students to extend their own knowledge after graduation by giving them the skills to learn new patters on their own. Finally, students will integrate their programs with native code applications to enlarge the application domains. To achieve best reusability, they also learn modular designs to develop component-based software. These help them meet today's software needs of cross applications and architectures.

First, a general model of the communication task is presented, including the layered concept by which each layer provides services for the layer above. First, the lowest (physical) layer is studied. This involves signal design, Fourier analysis representations, bandwidth concepts, transmission impairments and communication media properties. Then the next higher (link) layer is considered which involves organizing bits into frames, data link and error control methods (including frame sequence numbering and error detection principles). Multiplexing to share a link is studied, including frequency division multiplexing, dedicated time division multiplexing, and statistical time multiplexing.At the network layer level, there are two categories: broadcast (usually local area) and switching networks. Broadcast and local area network studies include bus, tree and star topologies, Ethernet, optical fiber bus networks, ring networks, and medium access control protocols.Switching and routing concepts for networks are explained, including both circuit and packet switching, datagrams and virtual circuits. Properties of frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks are described. Internetworking frame structures, routing and protocols are studied. Also, bridge routing for local networks is described.At the still higher transport (network end-to-end control) layer, transport protocols, including TCP/EP, are described.
