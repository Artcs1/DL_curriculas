Calculus I
Calculus is a subject about functions. This course deals primarily with the two most fundamental concepts in Calculus:
derivatives and definite integrals. It begins with a discussion of notions of the limit and continuity of a function. Then the
definition of a derivative is introduced, and techniques of computing derivatives are studied. Through applications to
analysis of functions, optimizations and problems in sciences, a student can appreciate the importance of the derivative. The
concept of a definite integral as a limit of approximating sums emerges naturally in the context of problems of areas. Hidden
links between the two concepts are formulated in the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus, which also provide a convenient
shortcut for computing definite integrals. A graphing calculator is required for this course, and so is the use of computer
software, such as Mathematica.
