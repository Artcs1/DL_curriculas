Introduction to Programming
The IP (Introduction to Programming) course presents the basic concepts of programming and teaches the student to solve problems by building computer programs. A program is "just" a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a task. However, finding the correct set of instructions can be quite challenging. For this, you need to learn how to divide a problem into smaller subproblems and find the solution for each of those subproblems. A large part of this course is dedicated to teaching students a way of thinking that allows them to build programs that solve interesting problems.
