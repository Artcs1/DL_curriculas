Rhetoric
This course presents an integrated approach to writing, reading, and critical thinking by developing the grammatical, logical, and rhetorical skills necessary for university writing.
/
Professional and Technical Communication
Expands students' professional and team communication skills and strategies in technical contexts. Integrates writing, speaking and group communication by developing and presenting technical information to different audiences. Written assignments focus on creating professional technical documents, such as proposals, memos, abstracts, reports and letters. Presentation assignments emphasize planning, preparing and delivering dynamic, informative and persuasive presentations. Attendance at first class mandatory.
