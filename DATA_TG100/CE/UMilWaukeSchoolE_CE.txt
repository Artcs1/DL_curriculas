Freshman Studies I
This course emphasizes close reading of “texts,” including not only printed materials but also art, photographs, maps, film, music, and other documents. At the same time, this course requires students to shift focus from the “micro” level of a text to the “macro” level of its context in a way that allows them to understand a problem in terms of the larger system(s) of which it is part. Critical thinking skills are developed as students interpret and synthesize these “micro” and “macro” elements of text and context. Similarly, personal growth is encouraged as students make connections between course material and their own experiences, beliefs, and values. A primary course focus will be rhetorical strategies for communicating ideas clearly, concisely, and correctly. Students will engage in some form of civic activity in the form of experiential learning that involves the larger community and society outside of MSOE.
