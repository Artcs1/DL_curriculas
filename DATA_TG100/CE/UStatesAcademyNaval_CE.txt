Electrical Fundamentals and Applications
Provides an introduction to AC and DC circuit theory appropriate to model shipboard systems. Circuits of resistors, capacitors, inductors and sources are analyzed to predict steady state and first-order transient voltage, current, and power. Impedance matching, filters, transformers, motors/generators, and three-phase power distribution systems are introduced in the context of shipboard application. Laboratory exercises use tools and equipment found in the fleet and allow for a comparison of theoretical and actual circuit performance
