Introduction To Computer Science
The study of computer science centers on two complementary aspects of the discipline. First, computer science is fundamentally concerned with the problem-solving methodologies it derives from its foundational fields: the design principles of engineering, mathematical theory, and scientific empirical study. Second, these methodologies are applied in the complex context of a modern day computing system. In this course we will address both of these important aspects. As a means for developing your design skills, we will discuss the fundamental features of a high level, general purpose programming language — namely C++ — and learn how to use it as a tool for problem solving. We will also consider the performance of solutions, and how to apply both analytical and empirical assessment techniques.
