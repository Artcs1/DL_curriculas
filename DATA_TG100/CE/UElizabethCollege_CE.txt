Science and Values
Many people now recognize that for both good and ill, science is value-laden, e.g., scientists are influenced by ethical and political values when they do science. Scientists are people, just like the rest of us. The truth is that values shape research methods, agendas, and applications of scientific knowledge. More controversially, it maybe that even theory choice and theory testing are value-laden. So all this raises questions, how can we inform our consciences and pursue implementations of scientific and technological developments that are just and respectful of human dignity? What is the responsibility of the scientist or engineer for the uses their work is put to? By what means, in which respects, and to what extent does science change our world and does the world change science? Which of these changes are morally positive and which are not? To answer these questions we need an approach to science that integrates the history, philosophy, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and economics of science and scientists into a comprehensive analysis. This course will introduce the student to foundational ethical theories and principles, and then apply them to various case studies in the area of science and values.
