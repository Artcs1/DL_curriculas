First Year Seminar
An introduction to multiple aspects of engineering as well as the university intellectual life. A primary focus is on programming and the use of computers within the engineering disciplines. Through a focus on hands-on projects performed in teams, the course introduces students to commonalities and differences among the engineering disciplines, modes of inquiry, project design, teaming, skills in professional/technical writing, persuasive arguments (based on evidence, logic and critical thinking), innovation, and the use of multiple languages (English, computing, graphic) to communicate technical ideas to colleagues and clients.

Calculus-Analytic Geometry I
An introduction to calculus for engineering, science and mathematics students, with an emphasis on conceptual understanding, problem solving, and modeling. Topics covered include: limits, continuity, derivatives of algebraic, trigonometric, and transcendental functions, applications of the derivative including optimization problems and linear approximations, antiderivatives, introduction to the definite integral, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
/
Reasoning
This course helps students develop the foundational skills of critical reading, thinking, analysis, and writing. Students will analyze and evaluate different approaches to formal and informal arguments, reconstruct arguments from a range of sources, assess the quality of various types of evidence, and demonstrate careful use of statistics.
