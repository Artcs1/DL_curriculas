This course is designed to provide students with a working knowledge of the elementary physics principles mentioned above, as well as their applications, and to enhance their conceptual understanding of physical laws. The exact model of instruction varies at different campuses due to different resources and class sizes. Students attend several class meetings including at least one lab or activity period per week. Use of a combination of computer-based and traditional lab exercises is expected and collaborative learning exercises will be used in both small class sessions. The introduction of data acquisition and analysis methods (often making use of modern computer tools) will be stressed in the laboratory/activity period. Course evaluation is based on a combination assessments such as homework, quizzes, lab reports, midterm and final exams, and other evaluative tools.

Matrices
The initial portion of the course teaches the fundamentals of solving linear systems. This requires the language and notation of matrices and fundamental techniques for working with matrices such as row and column operations, echelon form, and invertibility. The determinant of a matrix is also introduced; it gives a test for invertibility. In the second part of the course the key ideas of eigenvector and eigenvalue are developed. These allow one to analyze a complicated matrix problem into simpler components and appear in many disguises in physical problems. The course also introduces the concept of a vector space, a crucial element in future linear algebra courses. This course is completed by a wide variety of students across the university, including students majoring in engineering programs, the sciences, and mathematics

Signals and Systems: Continuous and Discrete-Time
Transient response, frequency response, Bode plots, resonance, filters, Laplace transform, Fourier series and transform, discrete-time signals/ systems; sampling z-transform. is a course designed to study the characteristics of continuous and discrete time linear systems. These include signal and power input/output relationships in both domains, impulse responses, and the differential equations that describe these systems. Convolution is an essential component of any linear systems course, therefore several classes will be devoted to this topic in order that students fully understand the concept. Fourier series is used to determine the spectral content of periodic signals thus illustrating how a signal is distributed in frequency. This is very important when determining bandwidth requirements. There will be a brief refresher on the trigonometric Fourier series then the exponential series will be studied extensively. The Fourier transform can be used to determine the spectral content of virtually any signal encountered in the undergraduate curriculum, aperiodic, or periodic. It is also valuable in determining the frequency response characteristics of linear systems. Some filter theory is included in the course along with the Laplace transform. Much of the signal processing performed today is done digitally so the remainder of the course will approach most of the aforementioned topics from the viewpoint of the discrete domain with a strong emphasis on sampling and aliasing. Finite impulse response filters will be introduced along with recursive filters using the bilinear transform method.
