Computer Science I
This course provides an introduction to the discipline of computer programming. Closed laboratory to reinforce lecture topics and introduce new topics. Course is designed to expose students to basic programming concepts and to the use of the C++ language. This course is designed to enhance the student’s ability to design, develop and test/debug programs. Each student will increase his or her skill in writing correct and maintainable programs. Emphasis will be placed on problem analysis and on the subsequent development of algorithms. Several standard data types will be discussed and the student will gain an understanding of the issues relating to the use, design and implementation of each type in C++. A major focus of the lectures will be to provide an overview of real-world problem solving concepts and top-down software design.
